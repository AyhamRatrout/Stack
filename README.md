# Stack
This repository contains my implementation of a generic Stack data structure using a generic LinkedList data structure. The Stack has been tested for functionality and the XUnit tests are included in this repository.

As part of internship as a Backend Development Intern at Foothill Technology Solutions, I was asked to complete a task-based training program. This training program involves taking online
courses to better leverage my programming skills as well as perform tasks (do projects) that help deepen an intern's understanding of the material.

For my first task, I was asked to implement a generic Stack data structure in C# that performs the following operations using the Console application template:
1. Push: Stores an object on top of the stack.
2. Pop: Removes the object on top of the stack and returns it.
3. Print: Prints out all stack objects.
4. Peak: Prints the object on top of the stack if exists without removing it.
5. Clear: Removes all objects from the stack.

I chose to implement the stack by first implementing a generic LinkedList and having the stack interact with that generic class as needed.

My implementation of the stack can be found in the src\Stack_classes folder and the testing can be found in both the src\Stack_Classes folder in the Program.cs class as well as 
in the test\Test_Classes folder.
